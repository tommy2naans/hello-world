# hello-world
Creating my first repository following the hello world tutorial
After just completing a degree in Computing, its time to focus on one area. Python was something i enjoyed so starting to learn more of it. I'm following a course on Udemy which looks very interesting and hopefully i can use the knowledge to implement some things in my workplace. 
That was a bit of waffle to show i can edit! ;)
